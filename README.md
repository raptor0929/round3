## Introduction

In Argentina and across Latin America, financial exclusion is rampant. High poverty rates, lack of trust in banks, and limited access to financial services hinder people from saving, investing, and building wealth. _Round3_ is here to change that.

## The Problem

### Financial Exclusion Crisis

50% Poverty Rate: Half the population in Argentina struggles below the poverty line, making traditional financial services inaccessible.
High Borrowing Costs: Exorbitant interest rates burden those in need of credit, while savings options yield minimal returns.
Distrust in Institutions: Economic instability has eroded trust in banks and financial institutions.

## Our Solution

ROUND3 is a decentralized savings and investment protocol inspired by Andes savings circles. Utilizing blockchain technology and smart contracts, ROUND3 creates a secure, community-driven platform for collective financial growth.

## How It Works

- Create Savings Rounds: Users form groups, agreeing on contribution amounts and frequency.
- Stake Collateral: Participants stake collateral in a smart contract (e.g., $80 for $20 monthly contribution).
- Generate Yield: Collateral is invested in secure protocols (e.g., Solend), earning competitive returns (11%+ APY).
- Contribute & Withdraw: Regular contributions are made, and yields are accessible once criteria are met.

## Market Opportunity

- Superior Returns: Round3 aims for ~17% APY compared to traditional savings options of 5-12%.
- Decentralized Trust: Smart contracts automate and secure transactions, minimizing fraud and intermediary costs.
- Inclusive Access: Bridges the gap for those excluded from conventional banking, fostering financial inclusion.

## Future Opportunities

- Credit Building: Users can build a credit history within Round3, unlocking more financial opportunities.
- DeFi Retirement Funds: Potential to develop decentralized, community-managed retirement solutions.
- Innovative Financial Tools: Round3 can lead to new decentralized financial applications, enhancing security and inclusion.

## Conclusion

We are redefining financial inclusion and empowerment in Latin America. With Round3, individuals can save, invest, and thrive in a community-driven, blockchain-based system. Let's build a financially independent future together
